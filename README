= ESCAPE Serves Configuration Across Plentiful Environments

This application exists to help in the development and operation of custom applications. It is designed to serve environment-specific configuration to a variety of applications in a multitude of environments.

It is particularly useful if your Software Development Lifecycle uses a 'build pipeline' for the promotion of code into production, but this is not a prerequisite.

== Quick Start

First off - this a Ruby app. Dev and tested with Ruby 1.8 on OSX.

Required ruby gems:
    sqlite (or mysql or oracle or postgres)
	openssl
    ramaze = 2009.06.12
    rack >= 1.0.0
    sequel = 3.2.0
    json
	
Optional ruby gems for testing:
    rack-test
    bacon
	Selenium
	selenium-client
    
If you have ramaze in your path, you can start the server with 'ramaze start'. If not, './start.rb' will work.

Once the server is up, connect on port 7000 with your favourite browser
