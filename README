= ESCAPE Serves Configuration Across Plentiful Environments

This application exists to help in the development and operation of custom applications. It is designed to serve environment-specific configuration to a variety of applications in a multitude of environments.

It is particularly useful if your Software Development Lifecycle uses a 'build pipeline' for the promotion of code into production, but this is not a prerequisite.

== Quick Start

First off - this a Ruby app. Dev and tested with Ruby 1.8 on OSX.

Required ruby gems:

    ramaze
    rack 
    sequel
    sqlite
    json
    mongrel
	openssl
	
Optional ruby gems:

	Selenium
	selenium-client
    
If you have rackup in your path, you can start the server with './start.ru'. If not, 'ruby start.rb' will work.

Once the server is up, connect on port 7000 with your favourite browser
