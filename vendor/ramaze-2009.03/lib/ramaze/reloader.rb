module Ramaze

  # High performant source reloader
  #
  # This class acts as Rack middleware.
  #
  # It does not depend on Ramaze itself, but you might have to adjust the
  # Reloader::Hooks module or include your own module to override the hooks.
  # You also might have to set the Log constant.
  #
  # Currently, it uses RInotify if available and falls back to using File.stat.
  #
  # Please note that this will not reload files in the background, it does so
  # only when actively called
  # In case of Ramaze it is performing a check/reload cycle at the start of
  # every request, but also respects a cool down time, during which nothing will
  # be done.
  #
  # After every reload the OPTIONS hash will be checked for changed options and
  # assigned to the instance, so you may change options during the lifetime of
  # your application.
  #
  # A number of hooks will be executed during the reload cycle, see
  # Ramaze::ReloaderHooks for more information.

  class Reloader
    OPTIONS = {
      # At most check every n seconds
      # nil/false will never trigger the reload cycle
      # 0 will cycle on every call

      :thread => false,

      # If you assign a block here it will be instance_evaled instead of
      # calling cycle. This allows you to use for example EventMachine for
      # well performing asynchronous cycling.
