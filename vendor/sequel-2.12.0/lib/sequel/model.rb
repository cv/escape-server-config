module Sequel
  # Lets you create a Model subclass with its dataset already set.
  # source can be an existing dataset or a symbol (in which case
  # it will create a dataset using the default database with 
  # the given symbol as the table name).
  #
  # The purpose of this method is to set the dataset automatically
  # for a model class, if the table name doesn't match the implicit
  # name.  This is neater than using set_dataset inside the class,
  # doesn't require a bogus query for the schema, and allows
  # it to work correctly in a system that uses code reloading.
  #
  # Example:
  #   class Comment < Sequel::Model(:something)
  #     table_name # => :something
  #   end
  def self.Model(source)
    Model::ANONYMOUS_MODEL_CLASSES[source] ||= Class.new(Model).set_dataset(source)

  # Sequel::Model is an object relational mapper built on top of Sequel core.  Each
  # model class is backed by a dataset instance, and many dataset methods can be
  # called directly on the class.  Model datasets return rows as model instances,
  # which have fairly standard ORM instance behavior.
  #
  # Sequel::Model is built completely out of plugins, the only method not part of a
  # plugin is the plugin method itself.  Plugins can override any class, instance, or
  # dataset method defined by a previous plugin and call super to get the default
  # behavior.
  #
  # You can set the SEQUEL_NO_ASSOCIATIONS constant or environment variable to
  # make Sequel not load the associations plugin by default.
